# Reflective Section for mygrep.sh

## 1. Breakdown: How the script handles arguments and options

- The script first checks if any options are passed by looking for arguments that start with a dash `-`.
- It supports combined short options like `-vn` by:
  - Splitting the characters
  - Processing them individually inside a loop
- It sets flags (`show_line_numbers`, `invert_match`) based on the options detected.
- After options are handled, the script expects two mandatory arguments:
  1. The pattern to search for
  2. The file to search in
- It performs validation checks:
  - Verifies enough arguments are provided
  - Checks if the given file exists
- During line-by-line reading:
  - Converts both pattern and each line to lowercase (case-insensitive matching)
  - Applies inversion if `-v` is set
  - Prefixes matching lines with line numbers when `-n` is set
- Special case:
  - If `--help` is passed, displays usage guide and exits

✅ **Overall**: The script closely mimics basic grep behavior while supporting combination of options and proper error handling.

## 2. Potential Feature Additions

### Regex Support
Replace the simple `[[ "$line_lower" == "$pattern_lower" ]]` check with:
```bash
if [[ "$line_lower" =~ $pattern_lower ]]; then

...or internally use tools like `awk` or `sed` for complex regex handling.

### Case-insensitive (`-i`)
- Introduce an `ignore_case` flag
- Only apply lowercase transformations if `-i` is provided

### Count matches (`-c`)
- Add a counter variable
- Instead of printing lines:
  - Increment counter when matches occur
  - Print final count at the end

### List filenames only (`-l`)
- Check for any match during processing
- After file is read:
  - Print only filename if there was ≥1 match

✅ **Note**: More options would require managing more internal state and adjusting output behavior.

## 3. Implementation Challenges

**Hardest part**: Handling combined options like `-vn` and `-nv` correctly.

Challenges:
- Required splitting strings character-by-character in loop (not treating each `-$option` separately)
- Bash normally expects separated options
- Needed careful logic for manual combined flag parsing
- Required extra validation to catch invalid options (e.g., `-z`) immediately

✅ **Outcome**: Improved understanding of manual command-line parsing in Bash without `getopts`.

## Bonus Features
- Existing support for `--help` usage information
