# DNS Troubleshooting for Internal Web Dashboard

To troubleshoot the unreachable `internal.example.com` web dashboard, I'll walk through the verification, diagnosis, and resolution steps systematically.

## 1. Verify DNS Resolution

First, compare DNS resolution between the local resolver and Google's public DNS:

```bash
# Check configured nameservers
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Query using system DNS servers
nslookup internal.example.com

# Query using Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8
