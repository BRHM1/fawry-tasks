# DNS Troubleshooting for Internal Web Dashboard

To troubleshoot the unreachable `internal.example.com` web dashboard, I'll walk through the verification, diagnosis, and resolution steps systematically.

## 1. Verify DNS Resolution

First, compare DNS resolution between the local resolver and Google's public DNS:

```bash
# Check configured nameservers
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Query using system DNS servers
nslookup internal.example.com

# Query using Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8
```

If these return different results (or one fails to resolve while the other succeeds), this confirms a DNS issue.

## 2. Diagnose Service Reachability

If DNS resolves to an IP, verify service availability:

```bash
# Test HTTP connectivity
curl -v http://internal.example.com

# Test with direct IP (bypass DNS)
curl -v http://[resolved_IP_address]

# Check port accessibility
telnet internal.example.com 80
telnet internal.example.com 443

# Verify local services listening
sudo ss -tulpn | grep -E ':80|:443'
```

### 3. **Trace the Issue â€“ List All Possible Causes**

1. **DNS Misconfiguration**: If the DNS server listed in `/etc/resolv.conf` is unavailable or misconfigured, it might fail to resolve `internal.example.com` to the correct IP address. This could happen if the DNS server is down or not reachable.

2. **DNS Propagation Delays**: If DNS changes were recently made (e.g., IP address change), it could take time for the DNS records to propagate, leading to a temporary unavailability.

3. **DNS Cache Issues**: The DNS cache on the local system might be outdated, causing it to resolve `internal.example.com` to an incorrect IP address.

4. **Firewall or Security Group Blocking**: If there is a firewall (e.g., iptables, cloud security group) between the client and the server, it may block access to the server on ports 80 or 443.

5. **Service Not Listening on the Expected Ports**: The web service might not be listening on ports 80 or 443 due to misconfiguration or service failure.

6. **Network Connectivity Problems**: There may be network-related issues, such as routing problems, incorrect subnet settings, or down network interfaces.

7. **Server Overload or Resource Exhaustion**: High load on the server (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space) could cause it to be unresponsive or slow, leading to connection timeouts.

### 4. **Propose and Apply Fixes**

#### 1. **DNS Misconfiguration**  
- **Confirmation**: Run `dig internal.example.com @8.8.8.8` and compare it to `dig internal.example.com @<local_dns_server>`. If they differ, the issue is with your DNS configuration.  
- **Fix**: Update `/etc/resolv.conf` to use a working DNS server or fix any misconfiguration in the local DNS server.  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
   nameserver 8.8.8.8  # Example fix
   ```
#### 2. **DNS Propagation Delays**  
- **Confirmation**: Use `dig internal.example.com` and check if it resolves to the expected IP after DNS changes.  
- **Fix**: Wait for DNS propagation to complete. You can also try to flush the DNS cache:
    ```bash
    sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
    ```

#### 3. **DNS Cache Issues**  
- **Confirmation**: Run `dig internal.example.com` and verify if it's resolved to the expected IP.  
- **Fix**: Clear DNS cache on the local system. For example, on systems using `systemd`:
    ```bash
    sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
    ```

#### 4. **Firewall or Security Group Blocking**  
- **Confirmation**: Check the firewall settings with `iptables -L` or check cloud security group rules.  
- **Fix**: If a firewall is blocking access, adjust the rules to allow traffic on ports 80 and 443.
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    ```

#### 5. **Service Not Listening on the Expected Ports**  
- **Confirmation**: Check if the web service is listening using `netstat -tuln | grep ':80'` or `ss -tuln | grep ':80'`.  
- **Fix**: Restart the web service or check its configuration to ensure it is listening on the correct ports.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2  # or nginx
    ```

#### 6. **Network Connectivity Problems**  
- **Confirmation**: Run `ping <resolved_ip>` to check basic connectivity or use `traceroute internal.example.com` to identify routing issues.  
- **Fix**: Fix any routing or network interface issues based on the output. If the network interface is down, restart it:
    ```bash
    sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
    ```

#### 7. **Server Overload or Resource Exhaustion**  
- **Confirmation**: Use `top` or `htop` to monitor CPU/memory usage, or `df -h` to check disk space.  
- **Fix**: If resources are exhausted, consider terminating high-resource processes or adding more resources (e.g., scaling the server). For example, to kill a process:
    ```bash
    sudo kill -9 <pid>
    ```
